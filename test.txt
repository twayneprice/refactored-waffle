Section 1

Well, it's awesome to have all of you with us today at all of our LIFE Churches and our network churches, we love you guys so much.  Those of you from countries all over the world, on the other side of computer screens, welcome to our family at church online.

Today, we are in the fourth part of a message series called "Being Rich At What Matters most."  Some of you may not have been here for earlier messages.  If you have not, I'll review some really really good news.  You may not know this but the good news is -- help me out -- you are what?  You are rich.  Every single one of you are absolutely rich.  You may say, "I don't feel rich."  But when you look at yourself, compared to people all over the world, we are massively blessed by God.  The good news is you're rich.  There's also bad news.  The bad news is what?  You are rich.

As much as that is good news, it's actually a challenge to us to be so blessed because it makes it more difficult for us to depend on God.  It's so easy for us to be distracted by the blessings that we have.  And the reality is, because we are so blessed, God actually expects more of us. To whom much is given, much is required.

Today, I want to talk to you about a different way of being rich, that you may never have thought of before.  In fact, this message, to me, is my favorite in all of the series.  And so I want to review our key verses from 1st Timothy, chapter 6, verses 17 through 19.  Hopefully, you've almost memorized these because we've covered them so many times.  This is what Paul said to Timothy when he was going to help Timothy help people who are rich.  He said, "Here's what I want you to tell them.  'Command those who are'" what? "Command those who are rich" -- now, who would that be talking about?  That would also be talking about us?  Right?  So this verse is for us -- "Command those who are rich in this present world not to be arrogant nor to put their hope in wealth, which is so uncertain, but to put their hope" where?  "To put their hope in God" -- and this is so powerful -- "who richly provides us with everything for our enjoyment."

God blesses us.  And one of the reasons is he wants us to enjoy these blessings.  Verse 19, he says, "Command them to" what?  Let's all say it aloud.  "Command these rich people to do good and to be rich" how?  "To be rich in good deeds and to be generous and willing to share."  We talked about that theme last week.  I want you to notice that God's Word tells us to be rich "in good deeds."  To be rich in good deeds.  To do good and to be rich in good deeds.

What's interesting though, when you actually become rich, the odd thing is it's easier to be "self-centered" than it is to be "others centered."  Have you noticed that?  When we get more rich stuff, we start to think about ourselves.  We start to think, "Well, maybe, I could travel."  There's nothing wrong with that, but we start thinking about traveling.  And "Maybe, I could redo my house."  Nothing wrong with that; I've done that to our house.  Maybe, you've done it as well.  "I'd like to get some new clothes," "I'd like to go to Disney World.  As soon as all of the kids are old enough to pee on their own, we want to go to Disney World."  You know, whatever it would be, when you get rich, it's easier to start being more "self-centered" than "others centered."

But Paul said that's not how to be rich.  The best way to be rich is to also, not only be generous or willing to share, but to do good deeds and to be rich in helping others.

So I would ask you this:  Since you are rich, how rich are you in good deeds?  Are you like rich, making a difference in people's lives in good deeds?  Like, you're rich in good deeds?  Or are you kind of like middle class in good deeds?  Or maybe are you poor in good deeds, because you've forgotten that one of the ways to be rich is to be rich towards God by serving others.  "Command those who are rich to do good and to be rich in good deeds."

Section 2

So I want to add a statement to our growing statement that we've said week after week.  You can read along in your notes, and then I'll give you the add-on line.  And it goes like:  God has blessed me" -- say it with me -- "with more than I need," what am I?  I am rich.  "But I will not trust in riches but in him who richly provides."  "Because I have more, I will give more and do more" is the part we're going to add.  Let's say that last part again.  "Because I have more, I will give more and do more."  One, two, three. Let's all say it together.  "Because I have more, I will give more and do more."  We're going to be rich in good deeds.

Now, when we talk about being rich in good deeds, we need to agree upon one foundational principal.  If you miss this point, you're really going to miss an important part of this message.  If you're taking notes, we're talking about good deeds and good works.  We need to understand that we're not saved by good works, but we are saved "for" good works. This is so exciting.  We are not saved and made right before God because we do religious things or we try harder or we stop doing bad things and start doing good things.  We are not made right with God by those good works, but we are transformed by God to do good works.  In fact, this is the way Paul described it in Ephesians 2:8 through 10.  He said, "For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith, and this not from yourselves -- this is such good news -- "It is a gift from God and it's not by" what?  Let's all say it aloud.  "It's not by works so none of us can boast."  We can't say, "I'm more righteous than you, therefore, I'm going to heaven and it sucks to be you."  Okay?  It's not by works, it's by his grace so no one can boast.  Then he says, "For we are God's handywork."  Another version says "We're his masterpiece, created in Christ Jesus" to do what?  Say it aloud.  "To do good works."

Now, this is what blows me away.  We are created "to do good works which God prepared" when?  "Which God prepared in advance for us to do."  Check this out.  God loves you so much that he equipped you with everything you need to do everything he wants you to do.  He prepared you to do good works in this world, and to make a difference.

Every now and then, you will sense it.  You'll think, "Wow!  Here's something that must have been on my divine "to do" list even before I was born."  You'll look at it and go, "Oh, baby, this one's mine!  I've got the ability, I've got the time.  This is one of those things that God gave to me to be a blessing to someone else.  I can be rich in good deeds to someone."  I don't know how it will be.  You're driving along and someone's got a flat tire on the side of the road and you're like, "Oh, I've fantasized about being in the Indy 500 pit crew.  Oh, this one's mine."  And you go up and say, "Ma'am, could I help and serve you?"  And you just do an amazing job.  And she's like, "Can I pay you?"  And you're like, "No, no, no.  I believe God sent me to be a blessing to you.  This one's mine."

Maybe you love cooking and you and the food channel are B.F.F.'s.  And someone is sick and you're like, "I hate that they're sick.  What can I do for them?  Oh, man, I'm going to make them a meal that is so good, they're going to be healed when they taste this meal.  This one's mine."

Someone at work is really having a bad day.  They're really down and you're like, "Everybody says I've got big ears.  They are big, they are larger than normal.  Maybe, I'm here to listen."  "I'm just going to kick back and this one's mine.  Man, I'm a good listener.  I'm just going to be a blessing to them and listen."

I was in a home improvement store, which is really dangerous for me because I can't fix anything.  But when you're in there, you start thinking you can, like, "I can do this."  And there was this lady shopping who was probably upper 70's, and she was trying to lift these giant tree clippers.  I mean, they're like as big as her.  I just saw her doing this; she couldn't even lift them.  I said, "Ma'am, can I help?"  She looked at me and said, "Oh, do you work here?" I said "No, I don't work here, but what are you trying to do?" She said, "There's this limb, I can't cut it down and there's no one in my family that can help me."  And "do you think this will cut the limb down?"  I said, "Ma'am, would you give me the honor?"  This one's mine.  I'm the one who saw it and I can't do much, but I can do this.  This one's mine.  "Would you give me the honor of coming and helping you get your limb down?"  She said, "Are you a yard boy?"  And I said, "Today, I am a yard boy.  Would you let me?  This one's mine."  Every now and then, you just realize, "God gave me the ability and God gave me the time and I'm not going to be poor in good deeds, I'm going to be rich in good deeds.  God empowered me to make a difference in somebody's life."

Section 3. MY GOOD DEEDS SHOULD POINT TO GOD, NOT ME.


So what I want to do is show you three different principals about being rich in good deeds, because God has given us more than we need; we are rich.  And because we have more, not only will we give more, but we are going to do more to serve people and bring glory to him.  Three thoughts about our good deeds.  The first one, if you're taking notes is this:  My good deeds should always point to God and never to me.  My good deeds should point to God not me.  This is what Jesus said -- and watch the power in his words -- Mathew 5, verse 14 and following, He said, "You are the light of the world.  A town built on a hill cannot be hidden, neither do people light a lamp and put it under a bowl.  Instead, they put it on a stand and it gives light to everyone in the house. In the same way, Jesus said, 'Let your light shine before others'" -- notice he did not say "so they can hear your words."  Right?  What he said is "that they may see your good deeds."  And then he didn't say "and they may say 'you're one heck of a gal.'"  He didn't say, "And then they'll glorify you for your faithful service."  But what he said is "they may see your good deeds and" who will they glorify?  "They will glorify your Father in Heaven."  I love the power of this. When Jesus said, "Let your light shine," he was not talking about your words, he was talking about your actions.

You may never have thought of this, but your actions may be the only sermon some people ever hear.  Your actions can actually be a declaration of the goodness of God.  And when you do something good, they're not going to say you're good, but you're going to deflect the glory to our God and say, "No, it's because he's good that I'm doing good."  You see, I'm not saved by good works, but oh, I am saved for good works that God prepared in advance for me to do."  And you're going to see these divine opportunities.

I'll tell you another story about yard care -- and you may actually think I like doing yards, but the reality is I hate anything that has to do with yard work.  There was, years ago, my grandmother -- she died in her 70's and she had to mow her own yard the whole time, and I hated this.  I hated this.  She was alone; she had this little electric lawn mower, and every time we'd visit her, I couldn't wait to go and mow the yard for her.

And when I became a Christian in college, I started praying, "God, send someone to mow her yard.  Send someone to mow her yard."  It never happened.  But in the middle of when I was praying, I lived in this neighborhood with older people. And there was this little lady down the street that would mow her own yard.  And I thought, "Well, if I'm asking for somebody to mow my grandmother's yard, I might as well mow her yard."  So I just asked her, "Can I mow your lawn for you?" She's like, "I don't have any money to pay you."  I said, "Look, I don't want any money.  I believe God's transformed my life and I want to do something to be a blessing."  She's like, "Oh, that's amazing!"  She said, "You're a Christian? I'm a Christian."  She said, "Would you pray for my grandson?" And so we prayed for her grandson, and I mowed her yard for a while, until I moved on.

And then I ended up becoming a pastor and I started a ministry called "Single Truth."  It was for single adults. A couple of years into it, this guy came and he's like, "You don't know who I am, but you and my grandmother used to pray for me because I'm not a Christian."  He said, "I heard about what you did for my grandmother and I thought, 'If you would actually do something like that for her, I want to hear what you have to say about God.'"  See, that's the power.  That's the power of saying "These good deeds don't reflect me but they're going to point to the goodness of God."

I don't want anybody saying, "I'm good because I did this."  I want them saying "God is good because he sent one of his own to make a difference."  You see, you are not saved by good works but you are saved for good works that God prepared in advance for you to do.  You are not going to be poor in good deeds.  You're going to be rich in good deeds to be a blessing to other people.  God has equipped and prepared you to be rich in good deeds.  So the first principal is my good deeds will never point to me, but always to GOD.

Section 4 Help Others

The second one, if you're taking notes -- and this is really really important that we understand and get this right so I'm going to spend a little more time here -- the second principal is this:  My good deeds must help others in the way they need it, not in the way I want to give it.  My good deeds must help others in the way they need, not in the way I want to give it.

A couple of odd examples.  Let's say someone's house burns to the ground.  Chris Beal, one of our pastors, his house burned.  I did not go over to him and say, "Oh, God put it on my heart to wash your car.  Can I wash your car?  I'd love to wash your car.  I mean, that would make me so happy." No, when someone's house burns down, they don't need someone washing their car, they need help in other ways.  We are not going to help in the way we want to.

If someone loses their job and needs help eating and putting food on the table, we don't say, "Hey, I've got this old crappy couch I was going to donate.  If you'll come pick it up, it's yours."  That's not going to help.  That's often the way we, as Christians, give.  "Oh, I'm such a good person. I gave the stuff I'd never use to somebody else.  Aren't I a great guy?"  Okay?  We're going to help them in the way they need it, not in the way we want to give it.  That's the way Jesus did it in Acts 10:38.  Scripture says this, "Then Jesus went around and" what was he doing?  Very simply, the text says he was "doing good."  We're going to be rich in good deeds like Jesus.  Jesus went around doing good.  And what else did he do?  "He was healing all who were oppressed by the devil for God was with him."  He was healing those who were oppressed by the devil.  He was helping them in a way they needed it.

What he didn't say was, "Hey, watch this!  I'm going to turn water into wine for you.  It may not help you get better but it will help you feel better, at least while you've got a buzz."  He didn't do that.  Right?  He didn't do it.

He didn't go and take money out of the fish's mouth like he did somewhere else and say, "Here's 20 bucks.  Go and have some fun."  He helped them in the way they needed, not in the way that, perhaps, we would want to give it.

So as Christians, we're going to make sure when we help people, we help them out, without hurting them.  We're not the hero.  We're here to help them get better.  And we're never going to do something they could do for themselves; we're always going to give them a hand up, and not a hand out.

Let me just tell you some ways, in my experience, I've seen this go bad with people who have good intentions. And we never ever think about it.  Let's take Christmas time. Families at our church are so generous, and they love to go buy presents for families who cannot afford it.  And that can be done very well and can be a big blessing, or if done poorly, it can actually be a curse.

Imagine it done poorly.  You go in and you buy things the family could never ever afford, perhaps, would even have a hard time maintaining.  You give an iPhone to a family who can't afford the data plan.  You know, whatever.  And you come in and you give all these extravagant gifts and the dad sits over in the corner feeling like a big old failure because he couldn't provide this for his children.

And the children, rather than being grateful for the dad, they already kind of resent the dad anyway, because he can't provide what their friends have.  The children look to you as the hero, and it disconnects the relationship between Father and children.  We have good intentions, but we never meant to hurt them.

Instead, if we're going to do this, we're going to give something appropriate, and we're going to let the dad or the parents be the heroes, not us.  We're going to give in a way that helps.

When you go on a mission trip, man, you follow the rules of the local missionaries, who are there week in, week out.  Here's what happens all the time.  Our great people go. And the local missionaries say, "Whatever you do, don't give money.  Don't give money, don't give gifts.  Just come and serve."  And then suddenly, you see a really cute kid or there's this poor single mom, and you look in your wallet or your purse, and you've got $40, and that's nothing.  And you know that's more than a month's worth of income for them.  And you, in a single moment, you could easily change their lives. And so you just give them the money without even thinking about it.  But what you don't realize is you have just undone what the local missionaries have been doing for such a long period of time.  And you're training them, not to get better themselves, but to depend on outsiders.  You wanted to help but you actually hurt.  We're going to be rich in good deeds in a way that we don't give hands out, but we give hands up as the church for the glory of God, to help people become better.

And when we do it, as the church, we're going to go the extra mile.  We're always going to go the extra mile.  And that's a phrase a lot of people use, but a lot of people don't know where that phrase comes from.  And so I want to show you where it comes from and give you an application.  This is what Jesus taught in Mathew 5:41.  He said, "If anyone forces you to go" how far?  "If anyone forces you to go a mile," how far should you go?  He said, "You should go two miles."  You say, "What does that mean?"  Well, in the time when Jesus was living, a Roman soldier had the legal authority to ask anyone to carry their gear for one mile.  "Hey, you, come here, grab my stuff, take this for a mile."  "Yes, sir."  You had to do it.  You had to do it, but only one mile.  A Roman mile happened to be 1,000 steps.  So when you walked 1,000 steps, you fulfilled your duty.  Jesus was saying, basically, "I know that's kind of almost humiliating and that's the law, but since you serve me, you're not going to just go one mile but you're going to glory God by going two miles.  You don't have to but you're going to because you get to."  "And you're going to say 'I am serving and under authority and I'm going to be a great witness.  Even though you didn't ask, I'm going to do extra.'"

And that's what we're going to do.  And I don't know how it will play out for you, but if you're babysitting for somebody and you want to bless them, you may just say, "Hey, this one's on the house.  I'm doing it for free."  And then if you really want to go the extra mile, and oh, we speak from experience, clean the dishes, pick up the toys and honor God. You didn't have to, you just had to get the kids in bed and keep them alive.  But you also went the extra mile and did something different.

When you're making a meal for somebody, you could run through the drive through and say "super-size it," and get them some fast food, or you could go to the extra trouble, the extra mile and get a salad and a main course, and some dessert and some utensils and some napkins, and maybe even a little gift and say, "I want to bless you because I've been so blessed by God."  We're going to go the extra mile.  So in our good deeds, we're not going to be poor in good deeds, we're not even going to be middle classed in good deeds.  You see, we have been blessed with so much, we have more than we need. Therefore, because we have more, we are going to give more and we're going to do more.  And when we do more, we're not going to draw the attention to us, but we're going to draw the attention to God.  And when we do more, we're not going to do what others could do for themselves, we're going to help be a blessing to lift them up, and make their lives better.  We're not going to help them in the way we want to, we're going to help them in the way they need it.

Section 5 MY GOOD DEEDS WILL GLORIFY GOD THROUGH HIS CHURCH.

This third point is far and away my very favorite thought.  And I pray this inspires you and lights you on fire to be the church in the way that God has called us to be the church.  The first principal is this:  My good deeds should point to God and not to me.  Secondly, my good deeds should help others in the way they need it and not in the way I want to give it.  And three, my good deeds will glorify God through his church.  My good deeds will represent God in the church, through the church, to give glory to God in all that we do.

In fact, the author of Hebrews in Chapter 10, verse 24 and 25 -- to me, this is so powerful -- he says, "And let us consider how we may" do what?  "How we may spur one another on toward" what?  "Toward love and good deeds."  How can we spur one another on?

My workout partner is here and some people say, "How do you consistently workout?"  I've got a guy who, for 20 years, spurs me on to do more in the gym.  "Come on Groesch, there's more in you!  Come on, Groeschel, come on!  Give, give, give!  Come on!  Two more, come on!  Two more!"  All right?  So what we do for the glory of God is we say, "That's all you can do?  Hey, You've been blessed, I'll do more, you do more.  Let's be involved.  Hey, let's give.  Let's round up.  Let's go the extra mile.  Let's be even a bigger blessing."

Now, when do we do this?  Not just like at work or hanging out with our friends, but we do it in the church and through the church.  Because the context of this verse, the writer of the Hebrews was encouraging people to continue to meet together in the fellowship of the church.  He says, "Not giving up meeting together as," quite honestly, "some are in the habit of doing, but encouraging one another."  When you meet in the church, when you get together in your LIFE Group, what can you do?  You can spur one on another on.  "Come on! Two more, come on!  Let's do more!  Hey, let's make a bigger difference.  Hey, who can we bless?  Hey, how can we make a difference?  Hey, where can we serve in our church?  How can we glorify God?"  You see, we're not going to be below average in good deeds; we're going to be rich in good deeds, because when you're rich in good deeds, Timothy said, "You find the life that is truly life."  If you just settle for material possessions, oh, they may thrill for a little a while.  But you really want to be full?  You really want to be satisfied? You make a difference in other people's lives for the glory of God.  We're going to be rich in that way.

Can I be really really honest with you?  You see, we are the church.  We're a part of the church.  I believe, with all my heart, that through Christ, the local church is the hope of the world.  And you have, within you, spiritual gifts, every single one of you, that God wants to be used in his church, for his church, and through his church.  Therefore, if you just come to church, but never use your gifts in the church, or through the church, then there's some good work that God prepared in advance for you to do to glorify him, through his church, that is not being done.  And I'm glad some of you are clapping, because some of you probably shouldn't, because you're not doing anything.  You're coming and that's a good place to start; I'm so glad you're here.  But you could go the extra mile and you could use the gifts that you have to glorify god, in his church, and through the church.

In fact, if you give me a moment, I want to brag on some of you who are like crazy rich in good deeds.  I mean, you're like -- if there's like rich, you don't have to work financial rich, you're like -- your mansion in heaven is going to be so big, I hope to live in your doghouse; that's how big your good deeds are.  Let me brag on some of you right now. Bill and Pam from our Jenks location, they busload in over 20 men a week from in a group, who are addicted, to bring these men into church and watch one-by-one as God is picking off these people.  You are rich in good deeds.

Bob and Barbara from our Yukon, Oklahoma, location. This is crazy.  They are a retired couple and they foster babies before they're placed in permanent care.  This retired couple, to date, has fostered 65 babies.  That is how to be rich in good deeds.

Brent and Linda, their life group, from South Tulsa, Oklahoma, they go to a boys' home and minister to these boys, bring them to church.  And so far, they've seen 20 boys be baptized and become followers of Christ because they're rich in good deeds.

The South Oklahoma City campus -- and now, we have a Moore, Oklahoma City campus, when Moore was hit with a devastating tornado, we were honored, as a church -- because you are rich, and give -- we were honored as a church to pour over two million dollars into the community, which is the smallest thing we did because we sent literally hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of people in to clean up debris and hand out waters.  Some just simply hugged necks of people who didn't even know where to turn.  And three of these people, Scott, Stephanie and Nick, helped, in particular, a single mom and her daughter, Deb and Katie, who did not believe in God until they saw the love of God through his church.  And now, they're a part, Deb and Katie, of our South Oklahoma City campus, and in the family of God.  That is how you be rich in good deeds; you represent the church, as the church, for the glory of God.

Jamie, in Owasso -- oh, those of you who serve in LIFE Kids in Owasso, you are so blessed.  Jamie wants to bless those who serve, and so just gives free babysitting for anyone who serves so you go out and invest in your marriage.  If you need a place to serve, move to Owasso and serve in LIFE Kids. I love Jamie's heart to make a difference.

Rachel, in Albany, who is fighting cancer, right after surgery, came back to church to minister to the special need children, because that's what she's called to do.  She believes, even before she was created, there was a divine assignment.  That one's hers and she's not letting anyone else do what she was called to do.

Tony and Becky, I love you guys.  You're half crazy, you drive 119 miles one way to Keller, Texas, where we're meeting in a school, waiting for a building to be finished here in the next couple of months.  They drive 119 miles one way to help set up, long before church even starts, because their lives have been impacted by the church, and are willing to drive that far one way to make a difference in the church.

And James, his LIFE Group in Midwest City, they decided to partner with the city and just got together a bunch of people whose homes were about to be condemned, or are way under code, and just come in and say, "As the church," and don't even tell a name, "We're just here to make a difference," and help repair the homes so the families do not get injured or get kicked out of their home.

Let me tell you something.  Let me tell you something:  That glorifies God in the church.  I would argue, all day long, that the government -- and I am not anti-government, but the government is not the best equipped organization to meat the needs of people in the world; the church is the best organization to meet the needs of people in the world.  And when we become the church in this way, and we are rich in good deeds, people may say, "Well, I don't even agree with what you believe, but I see that you love me," and they will know us by our love.

And in the New Testament church, when they realized they were rich, and it wasn't about the things, you know what they did?  They were so crazy, they would sell some of what they had and they would, basically, give it to the leaders of the church to distribute wherever and whenever and however they felt led to do so.

And let me show you what happened through this New Testament church.  Acts 4:33 and 34.  "And God's grace was so powerfully at work in them all that there were no needy persons among them."  No needy persons among them.  When the church acts like the church because -- say it with me -- God has blessed us with more than we need.  We are rich.  We will not trust in our riches but in him who richly provides. Because we have more, we will give more and do more and that's how to be rich at what matters most.  That's the kind of church that we'll be for the glory of God.

Section 6 Closing

"Father, thank you that you blessed us and called us and saved us, not by our good works, but that God, you saved us for good works.  Empower our church to be the church in the communities where we live and be a blessing around the world. God, help us to point to you and never to ourselves, to meet people in the way they need it and not the way we want to give it and to glorify you, God, as the church, through the church, to make your name known."

All of our different churches, some of you realize, "I'm kind of middle class in good needs or I'm kind of even a little bit poor in good deeds.  I'm a part of the church but not serving in the church.  I'm not serving through the church, and I want to be rich in good deeds."

I'm going to pray that God gives you an eye and a sensitive heart to see the deeds that he prepared in advance for you to do.  And when you see them, you're going to go, "This one's mine.  This one's mine.  I was created to do this and I'm so thankful God empowered me to do it."

All of our churches, you say, "I want to be rich in good deeds," lift up your hand right now all over the place. Fantastic!  Hands everywhere.

"God, thank you for a church full of people that want to be rich in what matters.  God, I pray that you would stir up the gifts within your church.  And God, for those not yet serving, I pray that you would put a burden on their hearts to make a difference in the church and through the church.  And God, just like those amazing stories that we heard, some actually very simple, others with a little more effort, that God, through the direction of your Holy Spirit, we can make a difference in this world.  Help us be sensitive to your direction to do what you've called us to do, to recognize the needs that you prepared us, in advance, to meet and to glorify you through your church.

As you keep praying today at all of our different churches, and nobody looking around right now.  Some of you, you've got to hear this and believe it.  You are never made right with God by your good works.  But you are and can be saved for good works.  The challenge is today, all over the world, when people think about God, we tend to think, "Man, I've been too bad for God or I've got to try harder to be good for God."  And what I need you to understand is that we've all sinned against God and our sin separates us from God.  The good news is that you can be rich through the blessings of Jesus Christ, and not just materially rich, but forgiven, transformed, filled with the Spirit of God and made completely new.

Jesus is the son of God, who is perfect in every way, died and rose again so that we could be forgiven, and you are not saved by good works, but by putting your faith in the perfect work of God's son, Jesus.

At all of our churches, many of you recognize, "I need to put my faith in him, not in my good works.  I need to trust him.  Today, by faith, I turn from my sins, I turn toward Jesus and I surrender my whole life to him."  When you do, you will be saved to make a difference in this world, not by your actions but by your faith, as you surrender to the Lordship of Christ.

All of our churches today, those of you who would say, "That's me.  By faith, I trust him, I turn to him and surrender my life to Jesus, put him first, asking him to save me and make me new."

All of our churches, those of you who would say, "That's my prayer," lift your hands high right now.  Just lift them up and say, "Yes, that's my prayer."  Right here in this section, right back here in the back section.  God bless you. Over here in this section.  Let me just find you, just leave it up.  Right back over here.  Welcome into God's family. Others of you who would say, "That's my prayer as well," right back over here, say, "Yes, I surrender, by faith, to Jesus Christ."   Those of you at church online, you can click right below me.

We're all going to pray together, just join your voices with those around you.  Pray, "Heavenly Father, forgive me of all my sins, make me brand new.  I believe your Son, Jesus, died for me and he rose again so I could live for you. Save me.  As I put my faith in you, prepare me to do good works for you.  My life is not my own.  Today, I give it to you.  Thank you for new life.  Now you have mine.  In Jesus' name, I pray."

Let the church shout aloud and worship and, thank God for new life in Christ.
